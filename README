The goal of this exercise is to test a candidate's knowledge of
Javascript and AngularJS.  It is also about testing how well a
candidate is able to transform an existing application with several
issues in it, to a version of this application that was built using
good quality code.

The assignment is to review the code of this application, to criticize
it and to present an improved version of it without adding or removing
any feature or external library.

Please bear in mind:
  * We are looking for good coding practices.
  * Design is not the primary goal of this test although it is
    important to understand how it impacts the application.
